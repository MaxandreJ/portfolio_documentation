# Introduction to selectors

**Document in construction**

This document introduces the notion of a selector, with a focus on its implementation in the language of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Selectors are found in every CSS document. Therefore, every student of CSS should learn about them.

I wrote this document for people who are already familiar with the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), but are only beginning to learn CSS. CSS beginners will find how to use selectors in this document. CSS beginners will however not find here a comprehensive introduction to CSS (for one, please refer to [w3schools][css-tutorial], for example).

A selector is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. The selector can be used to select elements of a document that match the search pattern. Selectors of various level of complexity exist in CSS. This document only covers some simple CSS selectors:

* the universal selector,
* type selectors,
* attribute selectors,
* class selectors,
* ID selectors.

*To be continued.*
