My name is Maxandre Jacqueline and I am currently looking for my first position as a technical writer. You can find samples of my work on this website. For now, I have only written one tutorial, but I am planning to write more. My entire portfolio, including PDF documents, can be found on [my Clippings website][Clippings_portfolio]. For more information on me, please consult [my LinkedIn profile][LinkedIn_profile]. Finally, you can find some programs that I developed on [my GitHub repository][GitHub_repository].
